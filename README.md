Camera charge cheat for Touhou 16.5 Violet Detector

A little program to help Sumireko camera recharge instantaneously. <br>

Used .NET Framework 4.7.2 with WinForms here. "Drag-and-drop programming" is the best for such simple tasks.<br>

<h2>Download</h2>
Download the executable from <a href="https://github.com/Cdimoy/BrokenDetector/blob/master/bin/BrokenDetector.exe">here</a> and launch with administrator privileges.
<br>
If game is detected, the "th165" label will turn green. <br>
<h3>Sources</h3>
The TouhouGame.cs file is the core of this little tool. 
<br>
With some adjustments it can be used for every Touhou game.
<br>
Other files contain mostly just auto-generated stuff.
